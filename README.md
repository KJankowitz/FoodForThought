## Introduction
This project gathers recipies in the format of a blog with database elements. For user interaction, there is also a polling 
function to vote on recipies. Authorisation practices are followed, and users need to be registered and logged in to vote on the polling app.
This project uses Django with sqlite for database handling and Bootstrap for styling and is packaged in a Docker container.
